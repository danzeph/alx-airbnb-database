# Project Summary — Advanced SQL Querying

This project focuses on advanced SQL techniques, performance tuning, and database optimization using a simulated Airbnb-style database.

## Summary of Completed Tasks

### 1. SQL Joins

Wrote `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` queries to combine data across users, bookings, properties, and reviews.

### 2. Subqueries

Created correlated and non-correlated subqueries to analyze average ratings and identify users with high booking activity.

### 3. Aggregations & Window Functions

Used `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `ROW_NUMBER`, and `RANK` to summarize bookings and rank properties by demand.

### 4. Indexing for Optimization

Identified frequently queried columns and created indexes to speed up filters, joins, and lookups. Measured performance improvements using `EXPLAIN`.

### 5. Query Optimization

Wrote and optimized multi-table queries involving `bookings`, `payments`, `users`, and `properties` to reduce execution time.

### 6. Table Partitioning

Implemented partitioning on the `Booking table` based on `start_date` to improve performance for date-range queries.

### 7. Performance Monitoring

Used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and refine schema design.
